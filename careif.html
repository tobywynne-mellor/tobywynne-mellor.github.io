			How what I have learnt from my first-year QMUL Model module to overcome barriers and support my future ambitions.
		</h1>
		<p>
			Hi, I'm Toby.
			I study Computer Science and Multimedia with a year in industry.
			<br>
			This year in my QMUL model module, Professional Research Practice, we focussed on three main things.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Note taking on technical concepts</li>
			<li>Presentation of technical concepts</li>
			<li>Technical Writing</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			I'm going to tell you one by one a bit more on how this has helped me overcome barriers and support my future ambitions.

			Presentation Skills
		</h2>
		<p>
			In this section I learnt what makes a good presentation, how to consider your audience and knowing your onjective. Also we learnt how to find accurate sources by being:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Selective as to not quote irrelevant information</li>
			<li>Systematic ensuring that you read sources thoroughly</li>
			<li>being electronic so that you make use of all the resources available to us on the internet especially online libraries that QMUL students have exclusive access to</li>
			<li>obsessive by checking the accuracy of your information through reading multiple sources.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			I learnt lots about how to do a presentation through the task to find the best suited open-source licence for a start-up daily vlogging business called 'vlogga'. As part of wthis I had to design a slide deck presentation which was informative yet easily understandable, as if I was pitching to non-coders but still undergraduates.
		</p>
		<p>
			To illustrate how the skills learnt helped me outside of my education, I will tell a story.
		</p>
		<p>
			In October of 2017, I applied to be at the 3 Day StartUp bootcamp run by the QMUL Enterprise Department. As a part of the application I had give a business idea of mine as a possible concept to work on over the weekend. I found out later that week that my application was successful. This is where the module comes in!
		</p>
		<p>
			Within that I came up with the business idea of a movie recommendation app which I pitched to 30 people. Within this I placed a heavy focus on technical concepts which I was able to explain clearly and confidently.The audience were from a variety of degree backgrounds so the development of the presentation of technical concepts was essential and proven in everyone's understanding. After the pitch I was approached to apply to fund my business which leads me to the next part of my story but I'll get to that in a moment.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was able to use my presentation of technical concepts aspect of the module again when I had to pitch my app in March to over 100 people. This time round I was able to explore the deeper science behind the app and explain in more detail what I am hoping to achieve with the development of it. As part of this pitch I created a presentation which was heavily influenced by the knowledge I had gained from this module! Everyone was a fan and the QM Enterprise leaders praised it's appearance and slickness.

			Technical Writing
		</h2>
		<p>
			In this part of the module I learnt how to keep my answwers clear and concise, how to utilise feedback and what makes a piece of writing better than another. We were set the task to provide a portfolio of short concept writing that we had already submitted to an other module. We then had to write a revised version and write commentaries - explaining the changes made in the revised versions and the rationale behind it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not only will these skills be transferable to my final year project, they have already helped me with the development of my business.
		</p>
		<p>
			After we were approached to apply for business funding from the University I realised I had to make a written application. This was brand new to me and at first glance it was daunting. However, I overcame this with the knowledge I had gained of Technical Writing from the Professional Research Practice module which became a clincher for us to winning funding of £500. Without it I wouldn't have been able to fluently explain my concepts, (it also gave us an edge on the other applicants).
		</p>

		<h2 class="title">
			Note Taking
		</h2>
		<p>
			Here the focus was on how to summarise articles, cornell note taking strategy and peer-review. There was an assignment for this part of the module; to write notes about the differences between software licences. To do this we had to do in depth reading of several research papers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The cornell note taking method has a three section structure.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Notes</li>
			<li>Comments</li>
			<li>Summary</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			These all make for a more engaging note taking process. This method allows you to follow the thoughts you had when originally reading from the source. It also makes it easier to do further research on the things you weren't sure about.
		</p>
		<p>
			So where does this take me now? Well after we were granted £500 I have begun to explore how to develop my app. I have now entered full research mode where my skills gained from this module in note taking on technical concepts have been essential! I have explored how I can apply AI, and deep learning in particular to know where to start my app as well as the pyschological factors that come into play when making a decision on which film to watch.

			Conclusion
		</h2>
		<p>
			I could have mentioned how these skills have helped me within my achademic work within other modules but I wanted to note how I am using these beyond that in my daily life and future career prospects. Without them it is unlikely I would have been able to recieve funding and take the first baby steps into creating my own business! I know I will recurrently use the information I have learnt again and again. The next step is going to be going for a £10,000 grant!
